* Data Types
	- program is represent by objects.
	- Inbuilt data type 
		1. Scalars- single value
			* Integer
			* Float
			* Boolean
		2. Aggregate type-
			* Complex-> 3+2j, 2j
			* String -> "shamal", 'shamal'
			* list -> a = [1,2,3]
			* Dictionaries -> d= {'Hello': 'there', 2 : 15}
			* Tuple -> t = (1,2,3) sequence
	* Integer 
		* normal integers-12345
		* Octal literals(base 8) 
			* Eg. >>> a=0o10
			    	>>>	print(a)
			    			8
		* Hexadacimal literals (base 16)-
	* Variable - container -hold value
		- symbolic name of memory locaton
		- references to objects
		* Naming rules
			* keyword/reserved cannot use as name
			* case sensitive cannot start with number.
			* Contain -letters, numbers, underscore
