OOP-based on concept of Classes and object
* Object - Atributes & functions- perticular thing.
	 * Example- CAR
* Class - collection of object
* Abstraction - hide internal details (lite, mobile)
* Polymorphism - many forms(Behaviors)
	* Ex. - A man at the same time husband, father, employee.
* Inheritance - like reusability.
* Encapsulation - All data in one place, like objects and class
	* Ex. 	class Rectangle { public: int length; int breadth; int getArea() 
				{ return length \* breadth; } };
